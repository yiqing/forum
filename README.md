```php
return [
	'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
	'dsn' => 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=forum', // Don't use localhost, Because IPv4/IPv6 recognition very slow to connect to mysql
	'username' => 'root',
	'password' => '1234',
	'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTE:** `forum.sql` in the root folder, import it into the database, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
